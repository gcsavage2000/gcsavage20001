                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The problem I set out to solve in Lab 6 was how to select specific areas that aren't already neatly divided into enumeration units.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I evaluated: What kinds of problems call for geo-processing operations instead of selections? How do you get the math of a Union to work for our problem solving areas? And, why are buffers and geographic distance useful tools for selecting (or not selecting) specific areas? The skills I learned through this Lab and making this map include how to use the following tools: Buffers, Multipart to Singlepart, Dissolve, Spatial Join, Clip, Erase, Intersect, and Union. </p>
                        <p>To get my solution, I started by creating an inclusive layer of all the areas where the new store could be located. This meant buffering the regional rail stations and subway stations, using the union tool to join the resulting shapefiles together, and then using the intersect tool to intersect this layer with the empowerment zones. Then I created an exclusive layer where the store could not be located by buffering the farmers markets and corner stores, and using the union tool on the resulting layers.</p>
                        <p> I then created the candidate areas by erasing the exclusive areas from the inclusive areas, and used the multipart to singlepart tool to clean up the candidates layer. Lastly, I added a field to the candidates layer for area and calculated the area of each shape using calculate geometry.The problem I set out to solve in this week’s lab was How to select specific areas that aren't already neatly divided into enumeration units. </p>
                        <p>The skills I developed in making this map have many practical implications related to effective city planning. In a city like Philadelphia, with several neighborhoods that have faced historic disinvestment and redlining, the ability to effectively reduce food deserts and ensure everyone has access to fresh, healthy food is integral to enhance equity and quality of life. A map like this one could be used by city planners in tandem with policymakers to maximize the impact of a new healthy food store.</p>

                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The problem we were trying to solve in this lab and in creating this map was how to make choropleth and proportional symbol maps using Census data at a national scale. Specifically, this lab aimed to answer the questions: Where does Census data come from? How is it collected? What projection do you use when mapping the continental US? What are the limitations of Census data? How do you choose the proper map type for your data and audience?</p>
                        <p> This map is a choropleth of the percentage of the Hispanic population by state in the contiguous US states.The skills I learned in this lab include how to use map layout, symbology, elements, placements, and data field identification and use for the purpose of proportional symbol and choropleth maps. To solve this lab’s problem and create this map I first used select by attribute to select only the contiguous US states and created a new shapefile of these states. To make the choropleth of the percentage of the Hispanic population by state, I navigated to the symbology pane, changed the symbology type to graduated colors, and selected the Hispanic population variable as the field. Then under normalization, I selected the total population variable, and selected quantile as the method. I then adjusted the color scheme and histogram break lines, and created a new layout and added this map to it. Lastly, I added the relevant title and graphic elements, and used the share tab to export my maps as a PNG file. Choropleths portraying this kind of demographic information can be extremely useful for policymakers who need to better understand their audiences and forecast how certain policy decisions might impact different states and populations within them. </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Map 3 - Maps of the World</h2>
                        <p>This lab tasked us with comparing and contrasting 4 different types of projections - specifically, to evaluate which parts of the world are distorted by each projection, how the projection affects how the map looks, and why projections matter and how they can influence our representation of the truth.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>The skills I learned through this exercise include how to use the project and define projection tools, how to find the coordinate system of a layer, and how to use the layout tool to present multiple types of map projections in one layout. To solve this week’s problem, I first loaded in all of the relevant layers into a map. Then, I created a landscape layout and copy/pasted my original map in 4 times, in each quadrant. Then, I copied the original map 3 more times into new maps, and copy/pasted in the relevant layers. For each map, I right clicked on the layer, navigated to coordinate systems, and changed the CRS to match the assignment requirements (Robinson, Mercator, Goode Homolosine, and one of my choosing, Mollweide). Then on my layout, I navigated to format map frame for each map and changed each map frame to reflect the maps I just made, each with a different CRS. Lastly, I used the symbology pane to add relevant titles to the map, and used the activate layer function to adjust the size and scale of each map so it fit the page </p>
                        <p>Per my research, the Robinson projection is commonly used to create visually appealing world maps. Overall, it does not preserve any particular element perfectly, but balances distortions of shape, area, and distance, making it useful for educational or reference maps, like ones you might find in an atlas. Shape and area are most distorted near the poles, which appear slightly flattened. Because of its distortion, this would not be a good projection for navigation or topographic charting purposes. The Mollweide projection does a better job of preserving relative area across the map, making it a better choice for mapping in cases where accurate representation of features is important. Like Robinson however, this projection does have some distortion, especially toward the edges and near outer latitudes, so it also wouldn’t be suitable for navigation purposes.  The Mercator projection greatly distorts areas near the poles, where landmasses like Greenland and Antarctica appear much larger than they are in reality. However, this projection has historically been used for marine navigation, which makes sense given it preserves angles and direction, making it more suitable for navigation than Mollweide, Robinson, or Goode Homolosine. The Goode Homolosine projection preserves area by interrupting the map in the oceans. This projection would be a good choice for mapping vegetation or land cover, where accurate area representation is particularly important. However, the distortion and interruption in the oceans makes this projection less suitable for navigation, and is somewhat disorienting to look at, making it less aesthetically pleasing than other options.  Overall, choosing the right projection depends on the purpose of the map. If accurate area representation is needed, Mollweide or Goode Homolosine would be ideal. For navigation, the Mercator projection is preferred, while the Robinson projection works best for general purposes where an aesthetically balanced map is needed. Each projection brings its strengths and limitations, and selecting the best one depends on the map's intended use.</p>
