                        <p>The problem I set out to solve in Lab 6 was how to select specific areas that aren't already neatly divided into enumeration units.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I evaluated: What kinds of problems call for geo-processing operations instead of selections? How do you get the math of a Union to work for our problem solving areas? And, why are buffers and geographic distance useful tools for selecting (or not selecting) specific areas? The skills I learned through this Lab and making this map include how to use the following tools: Buffers, Multipart to Singlepart, Dissolve, Spatial Join, Clip, Erase, Intersect, and Union. </p>
                        <p>To get my solution, I started by creating an inclusive layer of all the areas where the new store could be located. This meant buffering the regional rail stations and subway stations, using the union tool to join the resulting shapefiles together, and then using the intersect tool to intersect this layer with the empowerment zones. Then I created an exclusive layer where the store could not be located by buffering the farmers markets and corner stores, and using the union tool on the resulting layers.</p>
                        <p> I then created the candidate areas by erasing the exclusive areas from the inclusive areas, and used the multipart to singlepart tool to clean up the candidates layer. Lastly, I added a field to the candidates layer for area and calculated the area of each shape using calculate geometry.The problem I set out to solve in this week’s lab was How to select specific areas that aren't already neatly divided into enumeration units. </p>
                        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Map 2</h2>
                        <p>The problem we were trying to solve in this lab and in creating this map was how to make choropleth and proportional symbol maps using Census data at a national scale. Specifically, this lab aimed to answer the questions: Where does Census data come from? How is it collected? What projection do you use when mapping the continental US? What are the limitations of Census data? How do you choose the proper map type for your data and audience?</p>
                        <p> This map is a choropleth of the percentage of the Hispanic population by state in the contiguous US states.The skills I learned in this lab include how to use map layout, symbology, elements, placements, and data field identification and use for the purpose of proportional symbol and choropleth maps.To solve this lab’s problem and create this map I first used select by attribute to select only the contiguous US states and created a new shapefile of these states. To make the choropleth of the percentage of the Hispanic population by state, I navigated to the symbology pane, changed the symbology type to graduated colors, and selected the Hispanic population variable as the field. Then under normalization, I selected the total population variable, and selected quantile as the method. I then adjusted the color scheme and histogram break lines, and created a new layout and added this map to it. Lastly, I added the relevant title and graphic elements, and used the share tab to export my maps as a PNG file.  </p>

                        <p>The 5 states with the lowest Hispanic population and the Hispanic population of each are:
Vermont - 31,952
Wyoming - 40,203
North Dakota - 44,595
Delaware - 55,886
Rhode Island - 57,448


The 5 states with the highest Hispanic population and the Hispanic population of each are:
California - 2, 531,333
Texas - 1,928,473
New York - 1,155,822
Florida - 1,073,506
Illinois - 835,577

States where the Hispanic population is greater than the population of the least populous state (Wyoming) are:
Illinois
Michigan
California

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
